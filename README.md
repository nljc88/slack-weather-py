# slack-weather-py
Slack weather for specific location

This is setup to run on Heroku, using Heroku Scheduler to run the script every day at 8am.

Adjust the XXXX sections in each URL (Wunderground, replace XXXX with your API key) (SLACK, replace the XXXX with your incoming webhook) and adjust the location in the Wunderground URL's for your own

You'll need to create an incoming slack webhook and specify that as above.
